          <span>I'm sorry, what were you asking me?</span> Oh, yes, that stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic. It will, however, dissolve

        <h3>The word is out.</h3>
        <p>And you... are a killer. Apparently it's all over town. Somebody crossed you, you got angry, you crushed their skull with an ATM machine.
        </p>
        <h3>Don't you see how great this is?</h3>
        <p>Jesse look at me. You... are a blowfish. A blowfish! Think about it. Small in stature, not swift, not cunning. Easy prey for predators but the blowfish has a secret weapon doesn't he.

        <h3>You kill me right here and now.</h3>
        <p>Apparently I've made that very easy for you.

            <li>You can kill me</li>
            <li>No witnesses</li>

        <p>you and I both forget about Pinkman.

        <h2>He'll live.</h2>
        <h3>I asked to see you in order to... clear the air.</h3>
        <p>There are uh, some... issues that could cause a misunderstanding
          <ul>
            <li>between us and I think it's in our best interest to lay the cards on the table.
            </li>
            <li>My brother-in-law, moments before he was attacked, someone called to warn him.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Those two men, the assassins.</h3>
        <p>I believe I was their prime target
          <ul>
            <li>but that somehow they were steered away from me to my brother-in-law.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Because of this 'intervention'</h3>
        <p>I am alive.
          <ul>
            <li>And yet, I think that this person was playing a much deeper game.
            </li>
            <li>He made that phone call because he wanted a shootout not a silent assassination.
